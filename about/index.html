        		<h1>About Me</h1> 
			<p>I go by Magepowers in the Warcraft III community. If you played Korean RPG maps back when EntGaming was very active, you probably have seen me around. 
				I translate Warcraft III maps, mostly from Korean to English, and have been doing so for almost 6 years. This website will focus on showing off 
				the maps that I have translated, regardless of whether I am proud of the work or not. I don't have as much time nowadays to translate maps, but 
				if there is something that you want a translation for or if you have questions about translating maps, feel free to contact my email or on 
				Discord at Magepowers#2515.</p>
